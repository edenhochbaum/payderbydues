Perl
----
Install perl (at least v5.16) and plack
Install File::Slurp, Text::Handlebars, Crypt::Bcrypt::Easy, Net::Stripe,
Mail::RFC822::Address, Paws, Test::Simple
and DBI as well as the postgres DBD (libdbd-pg-perl)

Database
--------
Install postgres server and client, as well as libpq-dev
In the following commands, replace $username with your actual username.
su to postgres and create a user and a database:
  createuser -DRS $username
  createdb -O $username payderbydues
Then, run "psql payderbydues" and type in:
  ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO $username;

Install python (2.x, not 3), and python-dev
Install python-setuptools to get easy_install
Run "easy_install Pyrseas" to get yamltodb and dbtoyaml

Run: 
  yamltodb -u payderbydues ~/payderbydues/schema/payderbydues.yaml

Without the -u, it will print a bunch of SQL to create tables and the like,
with the -u it should silently create that stuff in the DB.

Test Data
---------
You'll have to do this manually with psql for now.
